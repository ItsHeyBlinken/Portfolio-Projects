Overview
This To-Do List application is designed to help you create, manage, and track your personal tasks. It is ideal for use in a store setting to stay organized with daily responsibilities.

How to Use
1. Extracting and Renaming Files
To comply with email security restrictions, some file extensions have been changed. Before using the application, you must rename them back to their original extensions:

Locate the extracted files.
Rename the following files by removing the (.txt) at the end of the filename  (See Below):

index.html.txt → index.html

styles.css.txt → styles.css

script.js.txt → script.js

Once renamed, the application is ready to use.

2. Opening the Application
Open index.html in a web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).

3. Creating & Managing Tasks
Add tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button.
Mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to them.
Click "Clear Completed" to remove finished tasks from the list.

Possible Future Use: Import/Export Functions

The Import and Export buttons are included in the app but are not currently necessary for everyday use. These features allow you to:

Export: Save the current task list as a JSON file for backup or transfer.
Import: Load a previously exported JSON file to restore or continue your task list.
If you decide to use these functions in the future, they are available, and further instructions can be added at that time.

Tips for Personal Use in the Store

Use this app to track daily tasks, customer follow-ups, inventory management, or other store-related projects.
Keep the task list open in your browser throughout the day for quick access.

Troubleshooting
If you experience issues with the app, try refreshing the browser or reopening the index.html file.
Ensure you have renamed the files correctly as described in Step 1.
